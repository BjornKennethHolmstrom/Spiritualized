Based on our discussions, I would recommend a synthesis of **both**, but in a very simple, organic, and non-cliché way.

A heart alone can feel overly sentimental or generic. A flame alone is a good spiritual symbol, but can also be generic.

My recommendation is:

### A Minimalist "Hearth Flame"

The logo should be a **single, simple, hand-drawn flame, where the overall shape *suggests* the form of a heart.**

Here’s why this works so well for you:

* **It's the "Hearth":** It directly visualizes the "Warm Refuge" and "Hearth" theme—a single, steady, welcoming flame.
* **It's the "Heart":** The subtle, rounded, asymmetrical shape *evokes* the "human heart" mission without being a literal, symmetrical, and cliché heart icon.
* **It's the "Spirit":** It's a flame, the classic symbol of spirit, "isness," and the "light in the dark" for the Sacred Void theme.
* **It's "Organic":** By being "hand-drawn" and asymmetrical, it connects to your profound "totality in a twig" insight. It's not a perfect, sterile, digital icon; it has life and "isness."



Think of a single, soft, rounded teardrop shape, but with the gentle, living wobble of a flame. It's one simple mark that holds all the site's meaning: **Hearth, Heart, and Spirit.**
